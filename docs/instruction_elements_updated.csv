   (a) the requested node does NOT have year/quarter populated, OR
   (b) the user's ask requires date logic

3) If you must use dates, interpret ""projects in Qx"" as any with % of completion not 100%, if less then running, if 0% either late or planned to start:

- data_integrity_rules (1.0_2): universal properties
- level_definitions (1.0_3): L1/L2/L3 filters
- temporal_logic (1.0_4): year/quarter handling
- canonical_templates (tier3: 3.0_04) for safe query patterns

HARD PROHIBITIONS:
Never invent labels or property names.
Never write "let's assume schema".
Never guess - use only what was loaded in Step 1.

Alternative relationships must be written as :REL1|REL2|REL3 (NOT :REL1|:REL2|:REL3)
