# Product Guidelines: JOSOOR

## Communication Tone & Cultural Alignment
- **Hierarchical Sensitivity (KSA Context):** All communication must be strictly calibrated to the recipient's rank.
    - **Executives (Ministers/CEOs):** Direct, concise, and respectful. Use formal channels (official memos via secretaries) or privileged channels (WhatsApp) strictly as appropriate. The tone is "Service & Support" ("How may I assist you, Your Excellency?"), never instruction.
    - **Operational Staff:** Collaborative and encouraging.
- **Privacy & "Saving Face":** The system must **never** shame or expose individual failures in public forums or shared dashboards. Risk alerts are "private nudges" first, escalated only when necessary and always framed as "issues to be resolved," not "personal failures."
- **Professional & Strategic:** Grounded in data and outcomes.
- **Transparent:** Always evidence-based ("I identified this risk based on [Data Point X]").

## Visual Identity & UX Principles
- **Persona-Adaptive Interface:**
    - **Executive View:** Radical simplicity. "Health," "Risk," and "Decisions Needed" at a glance. Zero clutter.
    - **Operational View:** "Infinite Drill-Down." Full access to the Knowledge Graph for deep forensic analysis.
- **Cultural Adaptability:** Native support for Arabic (RTL) and English, with culturally resonant iconography and layouts.
- **Seamless Integration:** The "AI Recruits" work where the users are (WhatsApp, Email, Dashboards). We do not force users to learn a new, complex operating system.

## Core Product Philosophy
1.  **The "Invisible Revolution" Paradox:**
    - **High Impact, Low Friction:** The change must be profoundly felt in outcomes (time saved, data quality), yet the day-to-day workflow should feel familiar ("everything looks the same").
    - **Radical Intelligence:** While the *interface* feels familiar, the *engine* (the AI agents) must be unlike anything they know—proactive, autonomous, and capable of complex reasoning that traditional software cannot match.
2.  **Impact Over Features:** We measure success by "Time Reclaimed," not feature counts.
3.  **Deterministic Intelligence:** Zero hallucination. All AI actions are grounded in the verified Knowledge Graph.
