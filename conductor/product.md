# Initial Concept
Clients are looking for outcomes, solutions to their pain which is the need for alot of resources to cover the load of work in transformations. Those people are not available as saudis yet the rules are still imposed and the expectations increase. so our core is providing reliable agentic ai recruits to the tmo team. Now, these agents will work most of the time in the background and unseen, only their impact will be felt, through the qulaity of data in the new intelligent dashboards and how th governing processes run differently and when they are called upon to explain something in a dashboard. Also The PM managing a project will feel it when he gets help planning and tracking his project. Its the impact, not the feature.

# Product Guide: JOSOOR

## Vision & Purpose
JOSOOR is a comprehensive **Enterprise AI Platform**, designed to serve as the cognitive backbone for modern organizations. While its architecture is modular and extensible, its inaugural flagship module focuses on **Transformation Management**, deploying "agentic AI recruits" to solve critical resource shortages in Transformation Management Offices (TMOs).

## Primary Value Proposition
The success of JOSOOR is measured by **"Time Reclaimed."** While a 20% reduction in workload would satisfy most clients, JOSOOR's moonshot goal is to return **80% of a team's time**, allowing them to focus exclusively on high-value strategic tasks.

## Target Users
- **Executive Leaders (Ministers, CEOs):** Who require high-trust, autonomous data governance and decision support.
- **PMO Directors & Strategy Managers:** Who need to scale their oversight capabilities without proportional increases in headcount.
- **Project Managers & Operational Staff:** Who need proactive augmentation for planning, tracking, and risk mitigation.

## Core Operational Impact (Transformation Module)
- **Background Autonomy:** Agents proactively identify gaps, update knowledge graphs, and trigger governing processes without human intervention.
- **Intelligent Dashboarding:** Dashboards are no longer passive displays; they are the interface through which agents explain reality, diagnose issues, and demonstrate data quality.
- **TMO Augmentation:** Agents act as a scalable, reliable workforce that "nudges" PMs, drafts transformation plans, and identifies risks before they escalate.
- **Contextual Memory:** Utilizing a 5-step cognitive loop to remember hierarchical organizational context and provide explanations grounded in ground-truth data.
