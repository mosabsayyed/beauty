# Architecture & Consolidation Plan

## Context
The repository currently contains a large number of specification documents, plans, and analysis files in the root directory. This track focuses on organizing these into a coherent structure and overseeing the "meta" architecture.

## Objectives
- Consolidate scattered Markdown plans (e.g., `MASTER_PLANNING_INDEX.md`, `COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md`).
- Establish a clear hierarchy of documentation.
- Oversee the implementation of the `Coding Agent Contract`.

## Current Status
- [ ] Index existing documentation.
- [ ] Archive obsolete plans.
- [ ] Verify `AGENTS.md` alignment with current `gemini-flow` capabilities.

## Context Files
- ../../MASTER_PLANNING_INDEX.md
- ../../COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md
- ../../AGENTS.md
