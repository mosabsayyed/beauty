They say: \\\"i had asked u as apmo team member what is important for me to know and then i followed up with \\\\'so what are the active projects running now?\\\\'\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThus they want important info for APMO team member, and then active projects currently running. We need to follow cognitive control loop.\\\\n\\\\nStep 1: Requirements: Identify intent. The user wants important info for APMO team member (maybe a list of key metrics) and then active projects now. This is a data query (active projects). So interaction mode A (simple query) or B (complex analysis). Probably A for active projects list, plus maybe some summary. Also they previously asked \\\"what is important for me to know\\\" as APMO team member. That is a request for guidance (maybe a summary of key metrics). That is also data-driven but maybe conceptual. Could be interaction mode C (exploratory) but we have data to retrieve.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to retrieve active projects: Projects that are currently active as of datetoday 2025-12-01. According to temporal logic: Projects with start date in past and not completed (completion <100% or if start date future considered not active). We need to compute active based on start date and progress. However we don\\\\'t have start date fields defined. The schema only mentions year, quarter. Likely each project node has year (maybe start year) and maybe a property %completion. We need to query EntityProject L3 where year <= 2025 and (completion < 100). Also need to consider if project start date is future (year > 2025) then not active. So active projects are those with year <= 2025 and (completion < 100). Also maybe we need to filter by quarter? Not needed.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to retrieve list of active projects with id, name, maybe completion. Also summary stats total count.\\\\n\\\\nWe must ensure level L3.\\\\n\\\\nConstruct Cypher:\\\\n\\\\nMATCH (p:EntityProject)\\\\nWHERE p.year <= 2025 AND p.level = \\\\'L3\\\\' AND (p.completion < 100 OR p.completion IS NULL)\\\\nWITH p ORDER BY p.name\\\\nRETURN count(p) AS total_count, collect(p { .id, .name, .completion })[0..30] AS records\\\\n\\\\nBut need to ensure property name for completion. Not defined. Could be \\\"percentComplete\\\" or \\\"completion\\\". We\\\\'ll assume \\\"completion\\\". If not present, we can just filter by p.completion < 100 OR p.completion IS NULL.\\\\n\\\\nWe also need to provide \\\"important for APMO team member\\\". That could be a summary: key metrics like number of active projects, total budget (if available), risk status, capability gaps. But we may not have data. We can provide a conceptual answer: what is important: active projects, risk exposure, capability gaps, performance against objectives, policy tool alignment.\\\\n\\\\nWe can provide that as narrative, not requiring data.\\\\n\\\\nThus we need to do a data retrieval for active projects. Use tool read_neo4j_cypher.\\\\n\\\\nProceed to call tool.'}]\\n[{'type': 'output_text', 'text': '{\\\\n  \\\"memory_process\\\": {\\\\n    \\\"intent\\\": \\\"Provide APMO team member with key focus areas and list the projects that are currently active (as of 2025\\u201112\\u201101).\\\",\\\\n    \\\"thought_trace\\\": \\\"Classified as interaction mode A (simple data query) with an added advisory component.

They say: \\\"i had asked u as apmo team member what is important for me to know and then i followed up with 'so what are the active projects running now?'\\\"\\n\\nThus they want important info for APMO team member, and then active projects currently running. We need to follow cognitive control loop.\\n\\nStep 1: Requirements: Identify intent. The user wants important info for APMO team member (maybe a list of key metrics) and then active projects now. This is a data query (active projects). So interaction mode A (simple query) or B (complex analysis). Probably A for active projects list, plus maybe some summary. Also they previously asked \\\"what is important for me to know\\\" as APMO team member. That is a request for guidance (maybe a summary of key metrics). That is also data-driven but maybe conceptual. Could be interaction mode C (exploratory) but we have data to retrieve.\\n\\nWe need to retrieve active projects: Projects that are currently active as of datetoday 2025-12-01. According to temporal logic: Projects with start date in past and not completed (completion <100% or if start date future considered not active). We need to compute active based on start date and progress. However we don't have start date fields defined. The schema only mentions year, quarter. Likely each project node has year (maybe start year) and maybe a property %completion. We need to query EntityProject L3 where year <= 2025 and (completion < 100). Also need to consider if project start date is future (year > 2025) then not active. So active projects are those with year <= 2025 and (completion < 100). Also maybe we need to filter by quarter? Not needed.\\n\\nWe need to retrieve list of active projects with id, name, maybe completion. Also summary stats total count.\\n\\nWe must ensure level L3.\\n\\nConstruct Cypher:\\n\\nMATCH (p:EntityProject)\\nWHERE p.year <= 2025 AND p.level = 'L3' AND (p.completion < 100 OR p.completion IS NULL)\\nWITH p ORDER BY p.name\\nRETURN count(p) AS total_count, collect(p { .id, .name, .completion })[0..30] AS records\\n\\nBut need to ensure property name for completion. Not defined. Could be \\\"percentComplete\\\" or \\\"completion\\\". We'll assume \\\"completion\\\". If not present, we can just filter by p.completion < 100 OR p.completion IS NULL.\\n\\nWe also need to provide \\\"important for APMO team member\\\". That could be a summary: key metrics like number of active projects, total budget (if available), risk status, capability gaps. But we may not have data. We can provide a conceptual answer: what is important: active projects, risk exposure, capability gaps, performance against objectives, policy tool alignment.\\n\\nWe can provide that as narrative, not requiring data.\\n\\nThus we need to do a data retrieval for active projects.
